    "##  Quick summary of the original GitHub project\n",
    "- Purpose: create a chatroom that works over a local hotspot (no internet required). One device acts like a hotspot (server) and others connect as clients.\n",
    "- Core ideas used: Python sockets (TCP), basic threading to handle multiple clients, message broadcasting, and simple text‑based protocol (e.g., exchange nickname first).\n",
    "- Typical files in the repo: a server script, a client script, maybe helpers for message formatting and README with run instructions.\n",

    "We will recreate and simplify those pieces here so you can run and test locally."

    "1. **Local machine only:** The interactive server/client examples in this notebook run on your machine (localhost) or your LAN IP. If you want to test across devices, run the server on the hotspot device and run clients on other devices that join the hotspot network.\n",
    "2. **Ports & firewall:** Use a high port (like `5555`) and ensure your firewall allows connections.\n",
    "3. **Run order:** Start the server cell first. Then run clients in separate terminals or notebook cells.\n",
    "4. **Do not run multiple blocking server cells in the same notebook kernel** — if you need multiple shells, open terminals or new notebooks.\n"
